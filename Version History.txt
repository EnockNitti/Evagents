Evagents v0.04:

Known bugs:
* when loading a saved world, achievements such as "first population" are re-triggered if they happened before save
  * Unsure how to handle. I guess saving achievements should become a thing? I'm hesitant.

World & Simulation:
+ The Great Terrain Diversifiation, Step 1: LAND layer is now known as "ELEVATION" and has had multiple changes:
  + Introduced Beaches: Value of 0.5, spawns where land contacts water (not every cell). Perfect for amphibians. Visually yellow
  + Introduced Mountains: old land val,=1, unchanged otherwise. World is seeded with # of regions= CONTINENTS, visually white
  + Introduced Hills & Highlands: =0.9, 0.8, & 0.7: unchanged land tiles, but with lung requirements respective to their values
  + Introduced Plains: value 0.6: unchanged land tiles also, but notibly generates as a large portion of the land area
  * Water is unchanged, still represented by a value of 0. Values 0.1 thru 0.4 unused at this time (will consider deep-sea later)
  ~ Intensified health penalty for having wrong lungs
  ~ New setting allows disabling of all land spawns of new agents (see note below in the New Configurable Settings section)
  ~ Water smell has been changed enough so that only water cells (<0.5) are counted
  * This is only step 1, and more features are planned!
+ Introduced Drought and Overgrowth Events: if enabled in settings.cfg or the GUI, every epoch, a new variable is randomized
  This variable effects plant growth, both the spread rate and the growth rate from hazard/waste
  + New Event messages display if the value goes too far from 1.0, called a Drought if <0.85, and Overgrowth if >1.15
  + Limits placed on this value, gets reset near 1.0 if it goes beyond. Settings.cfg-able (see below)
+ Introduced Live Mutation chance doubling or trippling Events: if enabled in settings.cfg or the GUI, every epoch, there is a 
  8.333_% chance that mutations will occur 2* as often, and 8.333_% chance it will occur 3*
  + New Event messages for these pre-determined multiplier values (*2 and *3). Any custom values will get generic message
  + Limits to this value are [0,MUTEVENT_MAX], a settings.cfg-able value.
    *Note: this setting is unique: positive values enable all levels of multiplication below the input number, =1 effectively
     disables the mechanic, but 0 and negative values introduce the possibility of epochs with NO live mutation with 50/50 chance 
     or less, depending on larger negative values which decrease the chance of the normal mutation rate event even further.
+ The Init of the World now behaves differently to induce species spawn:
  + Spawns 100 at init, a mix of frugivores and herbivores only
  ~ Carnivores will not be spawned in first epoch (=0)
  ~ "Population Bust!" messages now will not display during the first epoch
+ New Configurable Settings:
  + DISABLE_LAND_SPAWN: will prevent any agents from spawning on land tiles while true. Default true, GUI controler
    * Built-in logic in case world is generated with high ratio of land:water, which will re-enable if it's too high
  + REP_PER_BABY: intake per numbabies that an agent must fill before reproduction occurs. Default 4.
  + NOTENOUGHFREQ: frequency with which agents are added while population below ENOUGHBOTS. Default 75. lower values more frequent
    ~ reduced default ENOUGHBOTS value to 400 from 500
  + LIVE_MUTATE_CHANCE: chance per tick that any given agent will undergo a live mutation event. Default 0.0001
  + MIN_INTAKE_HEALTH_RATIO: This will be the minimum metabolism ratio of intake sent to health. 0= old behavior with no restrictions,
    1= no babies ever, 100% intake always put into health. Default 0.5
  + DROUGHTS: t/f flag for if droughts/overgrowth is enabled. Default true. Can be toggled by GUI and is saved per world
  + DROUGHT_MAX: float value which is the upper limit of the DROUGHTMULT variable. default 1.3
  + DROUGHT_MIN: float value which is the lower limit of the DROUGHTMULT variable. default 0.7
  + MUTEVENTS: t/f flag for if mutation event epochs are enabled. Default true. Can be toggled by GUI and is saved per world
  + MUTEVENT_MAX: integer multiplier which also controls the behavior of the event (see above). default 3
  + HAZARDPOWER: power factor of hazard to be applied to cell value. Occurs before HAZARDDMAGE, default 0.5 (square root's)
  + GRAB_PRESSURE: multiplier for Grab feature's force between agents
  ~ Renamed REACTPOWER to BUMP_PRESSURE. Backwards-compatible with old configs
  ~ Renamed HEALTHLOSS_BADAIR config to more accurate HEALTHLOSS_BADTERRAIN. Backwards-compatible with old configs
  - Removed REPRATE from config and settings. No use for it from old saves, cannot be converted
+ Improved confirmation of new config settings!
  + The output window will now tell you when ANY variable is changing, and which ones!
  + Enhanced the feedback of "old config file found" messages
    * Let me know if anything funny happens in the output window when loading configs
+ Added new achievements: "First to Generation 1000!" and "User, Take the Wheel!"
+ Added notifications for Aquatic, Amphibian and Terrestrial agent count blooms but only if at least one other type has a popuation>30
~ Removed all references to MAXPLANT, MAXFRUIT, MAXMEAT, and MAXHAZARD. All cell values now between 0 and 1
  ~ This includes removing an accidental meat reduction in the meat spawn code
  ~ All Cells are now assumed to have values between 0 and 1. This will have far-reaching impacts including doubling available food
  ~ To compensate regarding agent cell interaction, all intake rates have been adjusted including hazard damage and waste deposit
  ~ Drawing code had to be altered to keep visual colors the same (neon green food was not pretty)
~ Plant food now has a new feature: Tenacity - Plant food intake is multiplied by cell content (min: 1/4), returning less intake to agents
  as it gets low. Does not prevent its value from reaching zero however
~ Further decoupled plant and fruit food:
  ~ Changed plant seeding to be set off from a plant cell instead of fruit. (may reverse later, idk)
  ~ Fruit decays regardless of plant level, but double if less than FRUITREQUIRE plant (0.1 by default). Max decay rate the same
  * With the plant tenacity change, plant quantity may only ocasionally be taken below this value
~ Temperature Discomfort is now agent variable, and is calculated and reset only intermittently, to simulate slow heat transfer
  (really it's just to reduce processing time)
~ Loosened the strict stomach values of new herbivores, carnivores, and frugivores for initial and user-requested spawns
~ Adjusted the stomach logic of random spawns, they should now be more dedicated to one or two food types
~ Removed exponential decay of meat. Decays linearly now.
  * should this be a settings.cfg?
~ Changed carcass lifetimes to 3000 ticks
~ Fixed a major bug where settings which have a GUI button and were loaded from either settings.cfg or save files would not update 
~ Fixed a bug where plant cells would not decay at all if they were exactly FOODMAX
~ Under-the-hood changes to improve readability and functionality of code


Agents & Brains:
+ Genetic Red, Green, and Blue agent colors. Agents also have a genetic trait "Chamovid" which is the ratio of gene colors to output colors
  + New spawned agents chamovid in range [0, 0.5], meaning eventually bots can evolve the ability to fully change their own color
  + Gene colors are simple randf(0,1) and are fully shown to other agents if chamovid= 0
  * Chamovid= 0 is more common than values between (0,0.5) for spawned agents: officially = cap(randf(-0.25,0.5))
  * I don't remember where the name "chamovid" came from, but it's too cool to change
+ Re-wrote live mutation. Live mutations now can effect various other traits (not just the brain):
  + Metabolism (same chance, smaller size than normal mutations)
  + Stomach values (less likely & smaller)
  + New type of (rare) mutation: Mutation throw - throws the mutation rates absolute-normally, scaled off METAMUTRATEs
  + Clock frequencies (same chance, smaller size)
  + Temperature (higher chance, smaller size)
  * As noted above, these events can increase in chance with Increased Mutation Events
+ Sexual reproduction (originally based on just an output) now also has a physical trait: "sexprojectbias". bias+output>0.5
  allows sexual repruduction. in range [-1,1]. inheritable and mutable, is saved and loaded
  * 'Males' are now labeled when these added values > 1.0. It is in range [-1,2]. 'Females' when > 0.5
  * Reminder: 'Males' can only be targets of 'Females' who are ready to sexually reproduce. 'Females' can reproduce w/ each other
+ New Brain 'layering' system. After implementing a debugging tool for tracing brain outputs, it was discovered the brains are still
  overnetworked, even fresh spawns. Init agents outputs are either connected to all inputs (either directly or indirectly) or between 0-5.
  + Brain boxes now initially can connect ONLY to boxes before it or itself
  * This does not apply to mutations!
  ~ Init Dead Conns rate increased slightly
+ New Brain Mutation: Mirror Input Weight - Connection changes its weight to the nagative of another conn (or even itself)
  * This should greatly improve the validity and occurence of Comparison Nodes, which for some applications are invaluable
+ Tiny agents (radius<=5) get major feature penalties:
  - Half of NUMEYES eyes
  - No second ear
  - No Clock 2 or 3
  - Unable to raise spike
  * note that all these "removed" features are not removed from brain, only processing is disabled, so the inputs are 0 const.
  ~ To indicate this, Tiny Agents' borders are drawn as white
+ Radius has other new effects on features:
  + Large agents take reduced damage from spike attacks. Tiny, small, & mean radius agents barely effected, r=20 take half damage, and
    agents who manage to get up to 30 units radius will take almost no damage even from max possible spike damage
  + Small agents move slower and large agents move faster. Base agent speed has been reduced so large agents aren't too fast
    * this change effects wheel output, so small agents will have a much harder time breaking from grabs
+ Jumping agents get to breathe a min value of 0.5, allowing amphibians and some terrestrials to survive in water as long as they keep
  resurfacing! Otherwise, jumping behaves as normal and is actually bad for aquatics if used too often
+ Started laying groundwork for "Encumbered" system: agents with -rep counter or mis-matching terrain mobility types
  receive flat reduced movement speed (-70%)
  * For terrain mis-matching, a difference of 0.57 for terrain type translates to encumberment triggered. This means amphibians get a
    another buff and can't get encumbered by either land or water.
~ Note that what constitutes an amphibian has changed: 0-0.25 is aquatic, 0.25-0.5 is amphibian, and 0.5-1 is terrestrial
~ Re-wrote reproduction trigger code significantly:
  + The reset value of Rep Counter now determined by NumBabies * REP_PER_BABY (settings config) * sqrt(radius/MEANRADIUS), (minimum of 15
    for now, REP_PER_BABY= 4). Species which have more or larger babies must collect more food (or have higher metabolism), but those with
    just a couple children and average radius are rewarded
  - Only the mother's REPCOUNTER is reset when reproducing; the father is able to continue reproducing (scandalous!)
  ~ Sex-Projecting agents >0.9 cannot be mothers. These changes together may make resolution of sexes more advantageous
    * upon second thought I don't like this change and it may be reverted. Fathers can't be mothers for physical reasons!
  ~ Mutation of the Numbabies agent variable now has a minimum std of 0.1, should be more common for variation
~ Scaled up the chances of the less likely brain mutations
~ changed init Brain Conn Weight values from randf(-10,10) to randn(0, 2). Gausian dist. around 0, std deviation 2
~ changed init Brain Box Bias values from randf(-1,1) to randf(-10,10). Bias still applied before all conns and sigmoid.
~ Re-wrote food intake code significantly to simplify processing and fix issues:
  ~ STOMACH_EFF was being directly applied twice against an agent even if they were perfectly adapted to one food type
  ~ STOMACH_EFF itself has been decreased from 0.3 to 0.25. This means if 2 stomach values are 100%, each intake is *0.25 (*0.5 overall)
  ~ Speed multiplier for food intake now more unforgiving for fast movers and turners (pow^3). Must be moving slow to eat!
  ~ Fixed odd code which made the amount of food in cell, if low, alter how quickly the agents ate it. Now more constant intake expected
    (except with plant food which has retained this in the form of the Tenacity feature)
~ Aging changes:
  ~ <TENDERAGE agents now take 25%+ damage from colisions instead of 50%+ (still 100& at TENDERAGE and above)
  ~ Age counter now counts up every 1/10th day and depends on the Settings variable FRAMES_PER_DAY
  ~ All displays regarding age now display it as 1/10ths. These changes mean age now counts # days agent has been alive
  * this also means TENDERAGE currently kicks in at visualized age 1.0, instead of 10. May update variable type later
~ Speaking of aging, the age counter itself if now based on the length of day (specifically, it counts up every 1/10th day)
~ Adjusted Waste rate and deposition mechanic. Before, a fine saw-tooth function was the result, which would push bots toward lower rates
  (aka agents with the "runs") because of a small advantage. Now should be more constant w/ no optimum
~ Disabled OVERHEAL_REPFILL by default, can still be re-enabled by settings.cfg
~ Increased collision damage and decreased safe overlap distance
~ Boost speed multiplier now *3. Healthloss mult is still *4, both can still be re-settings.cfg-ed
~ Decreased birth mutation rates for temperature preference, lungs, and stomach for balancing
~ Reduced live mutation rate of metabolism to compensate for event frequency
~ Increased mutation rates of multiple types of brain box mutations
~ Adjusted healthloss from uncomfortable temperature
~ The randomly gen-ed Eye FOV has been reduced from randf(0.3,2) to randf(0.01, 1.5)
~ Eye FOV mutations now no longer clamped at 0. Instead, absolute value of randn is taken, making every eye continue to be useful


Graphics & Control:
~ Map Layer now displays colors and representations of ALL LAYERS SIMULTANEOUSLY!!!
  + Terrain alone is now dark grey for land, blue for water
  + Plant layer colors is added and will "green-ify" land, brighten water with "algae"
  + Hazard also discolors the terrain and is made darker for water (scummier) and more purple for land
  + Meat appears as small "chunks" which are sized and shaded based on quantity
  + Light is applied to every cell!
  * Note: Fruit are not currently represented. I want to have little pixels with random positions for berries,
    but I need them to not change position every tick, so a pseudo-random system needs to be developed
+ New Mouseover Context Popup: on all layer displays except "Map" and "off", a context popup will display for the world cell under
  the cursor.
  + This will show the name of the layer, the x and y coords of the cell, and its value, as well as any special details
  + The display of this popup intelligently turns off if not over a cell, freezes if scrolling, and updates live while paused
  * This is a GREAT debug tool! Visualizing the exact contents of a cell has long been a needed feature!
+ The Historical Graph now shows the proportion of population which is aquatic, amphibious, or terrestrial
  * Indicated by shaded regions under the Total Alive curve.
+ When "m" is pressed to speed up the sim, all current notifications are dismissed, opening up room for new ones during Fast Mode
  * The same does not happen when resuming from Fast Mode, allowing you to read all events which happened while unrendered
+ Added some new notification colors
+ Inputs on the selected agent brain display now have colored R,G,B's for each of the eyes
+ Pressing "end" key while in DEBUG mode will now generate a verbose agent report and pause the simualtion
+ Added new DEBUG feature: Rotate Stomach of Selected Agent. Will force the selected agent's stomach values to shuffle. ~ key
+ When agent visualization is changed, a notification is now displayed telling the user what is being visualized
~ GUI now has a "World Options" rollout, which starts minimized and reveals the following when opened:
  ~ Load, Save, and New World buttons are now here
  ~ Closed world is now "Disable Spawns" in GUI and has been relocated here
  + Disable Land Spawns: see "World & Simulation" for details
  + Moon Light: works as before but now with a GUI control
  + Global Droughts: toggles the global drought/overgrowth system
  + Mutation Events: toggles the increased mutation event system
~ Adjusted many visuals and reformatted code to allow VERY easy access to change colors when desired (hardcoded only)
  ~ moonlight brightness on light layer is darker
  ~ Temperature discomfort now is light blue for perfectly comfortable and a slightly deeper blue right above 0 to orange @1
  ~ left and right wheels are now colored magenta and neon, respectively. The brain output indicator texts are likewise colored
  ~ many other minor changes
~ Historical Graph now centered in its horizontal space and the text alignment changes to avoid the world space
~ World init will now be auto-zoomed as if 'q' was pressed (this change was long overdue)
~ When view mode is set to Health, giving and receiving outlines are enlarged
~ The old rendered stats & indicators are now DEBUG features
~ Multiple key bindings now need DEBUG mode to use: kill selected, heal selected, reproduce selected, mutate selected
~ Divided "Layer::" from display code, creating "Display::" enum: now there's no ugly code! (That is a big fat lie)
~ Fixed a bug where give/receive health was drawn based on the "Giving" output instead of the amount of health traded
~ Fixed a bug with the selected agent display ghost being also set to a large radius when zoomed out


Reports & Saves:
!!!OLD SAVES: Rated as "NOT COMPATIBLE" due to REPRATE, MAX[cells], stomach & intake changes, encumbered system, chromavid & color genes,
  and new sexual projection bias features
  + Added a small compatability feature where cell contents are doubled from saves (due to MAX[cells] variables elimination)
  * All other compatability features removed for previous save handling (there wasn't that many)
  * currently the sim does not save configs per world, however that is on the todo list.
+ Saves now include the saved brain input, output and connection number, as well as the world width, height, and cell size
  * This is used for comparison of the version of the file when loading only and nothing is loaded yet. Hopefully soon
+ added count of Live Mutations to report
+ added the global Drought Multiplier and Mutation Multiplier current setting to report.txt
+ added random agent children count stat to report.txt
+ Added a new reporting feature: brain box back-trace. The system looks at the output and traces ALL connections it has, looking for 
  what inputs contribute at least a weight value of 0.25 (not overall, 0.25 intermediate nodes are cumulative)
  * Currently configured only for tracing back the wheel outputs. Use the 'e' key to print out results to output window
- removed random agent color value reporting
- All references to the old save file extention ".SCB" removed. Autosave file now correctly named
- Removed loading of DEBUG flags of the world, which was not even saved
~ The Load and Save prompts now automatically handle file extentions. Please only type the file name to in all saveing/loading dialogues
~ Changed all references to "dfood" to more accurate "dhealth". old saves still interpreted correctly
~ Fixed a bug with loading where a new random plant and fruit population would be generated beforehand (oops)


! Note About Evolution Goals:
 This version has seen many changes to features reducing the mutation rates and chances, leading to less short term variety.
This is intentional. The current expectation is to get agents to form within current primary Niches (Frugivore, Herbivore, 
Carnivore / Aquatic, Amphibian, Terrestrial / Cold-loving, Temperate, Heat-loving) and stay there, and highlight that minor
changes over time still result in variety. Also, since Carnivores take so long to develop (if at all), we wanted to put
all the other features in the Niche-variety category on the same timescale.
 As a result, you can expect a much longer time between significant changes, but we hope that it makes the sim no less
interesting!





October 2018
Evagents v0.03:

Agents & Brains:
+ New Output: Grab Angle! Now agents can specify an angle for their grab function. Since the range of angles is 2PI, and all 
  outputs are [0,1], the output is stretched such that 0 and 1 represent the same angle of 0 relative to the agent's front
  ~ Grab now pulls other agents towards the angle it's set at rather than just towards each other
+ New Output: Waste Deposit Rate! Agents can control themselves (partially) and change their rate of waste deposit.
  Agents with low deposition rate (max of ~50 ticks) will deposit large amounts, high rates (min of 1/tick) will deposit low amounts
  High tick rates produce waste everywhere. If agents can avoid Hazard, low deposit rates are hyper-efficient
+ Introduced Exhaustion: Output boxes values are summed, added to last tick's exhaustion value, and reduced by a constant
  + Exhaustion then reduces the rate of Output -> physical interactions, so voice, wheel speed, jump, boost, etc get reduced
    when exhaustion is high, as well as Agent intake, so health recovery becomes difficult
  + BASEEXHAUSTION setting, default -5, meaning agents have 5 free constant-full outputs. Configurable in settings.cfg
  * Exhaustion value is preserved with world saving/loading
+ TENDERAGE babies take reduced damage from collision events starting with a 50% reduction at age 0
  * TENDERAGE now controls 3 features: reduced meat on death, reduced waste deposition while alive, and collision injury reduction.
+ Added a "Branch Box" mutation: a box gets one of its conns set to a box which refers to a box that another conn's box refers to...
  It's better to show a diagram:
 [b]
 / \+create this conn
[][]
 \/
 []
~ Fixed grab persisting after grabbed agent death (all cases)
~ (Mostly) fixed how Clock3 input would rapidly jiggle at the slightest change in the output value
~ Optimized the brain mutation and reproduction code (was processing the input boxes... oops)
~ Fixed giving: Selfish agents will never display give, and a minor bug with target agent overhealing was fixed
~ Dead agents go silent much faster (from 10% reduction per tick to 80%)
~ Changed default HEALTHLOSS_WHEELS to 0, trying out Exhaustion mechanic
- removed MINMOMHEALTH health/repcounter priority adjuster, too many agents getting arteficially stuck at 0.25 health

World & Simulation:
+ New Configurable Settings:
  + EXHAUSTION_MULT: multiplier for
  + BASEEXHAUSTION: units of exhaustion which all agents are given every tick. Strongly recommend this be negative or zero
  ~ Changed: OVERHEAL_REPFILL is now a float value, and directly effects the rate of rep-fill from overhealth, default 50%
  ~ Changed: SPIKEMULT -> DAMAGE_FULLSPIKE: is now the exact damage an agent's spike does at full speed and full extension
  ~ Changed: HEALTHLOSS_JAWSNAP -> DAMAGE_JAWSNAP: moved, but same mechanic. Backwards-compatible (loads old variable name)
  ~ Changed: HEALTHLOSS_BUMP -> DAMAGE_COLLIDE: moved, but same mechanic. Also backwards-compatible
+ Days counting: current Day of Epoch is now reported on the window title, the output window, and in the reports
  Days match the light cycle and start on 1, based on modcounter
+ Added Global Event Notifications: Short-term Population booms and busts, booms of specific stomach type, and population crashes
  are detected and reported (in sim only)
+ Added Global Achievements: First stable population, first population > 500, first generation > 500, etc. Can you get them all?
+ Added Agent Event Notifications: Selected Agent Decay (deleted) and Selected Agent Reproduced (both modes)
+ New Help text-on-demand: press 'h' to display hints specifically for how to use the program
  ~Changed or removed many of the hints for simulation control at world start during epoch 0
~ changed default FRUITREQUIRE value to 0.1, down from 0.5, to isolate fruit and plant sources and promote specitation
  *Has worked spectacularly, now a frequent observation to have 2 species in same physical space!
~ changed some default global settings: Epochs last 200000 frames, Days last 4000 frames, there will be 200 reports per epoch
  this means the in-game graph shows one Epochs-worth of data, containing 50 "days", but same number of ticks as before
~ Changed INITFOODDENSITY and INITFRUITDENSITY to instead be in units of Cells. Now accurately tells the ratio of plant and fruit
  that is intended to be on the map
  *Additionally simplified and corrected related features to speed up generation process with certain settings (such as food
   density set to 1, will actually populate a world full of food, instead of an endless spawn loop)
~ Changed carcass lifetimes to 2000 ticks
~ Changed "Freshkill not true" meat value to 50%, up from 25%. More meat for kills/deaths in general
~ Increased Freshkill timer greatly, 50 ticks instead of 10
~ Further adjusted the OCEANPERCENT and terrain generation algorithm to align better, +/- about 15% in mid-ranges, more accurate
  close to 0.0 and 1.0 settings
~ Changed Autoselect mechanics slightly so that if no agent stands above the baseline the simulation returns to "None" 
- slightly restructured the use of ReadWrite in GLView by no longer creating multiple instances of the helper class, just one

Graphics & Control:
+ "Page Up" and "Page Down" keys now function to select, when an agent is selected, another agent with a species ID within 
  MAXDEVIATION of the current selection, prefering exactly +/- 1 difference in species ID. No preference for location/relation
  Best used with the "Crossable" agent color scheme to quickly see species spread
+ New Input/Output box labels:
  *Health sensor - letter "H" of a color indirectly indicating health (like the health display mode)
  *Blood Sensor - red letter "B"
  *Player Input - white "+"
  *Jump Output - yellow "J"
  *Boost Output - grey "B"
  *Grab Angle - blue "<"
  *Fruit, Hazard, Meat, Water, and Agent Smells - yellow, purple, red, blue, and white "S"s
+ Added a way to dismiss event messages via right-click menu option.
+ Events now have color indicating the source/type of alert:
  *White	-selected agent
 action
  *Red		-global bad statistic
  *Green	-global good
 statistic
  *Blue 	-
selected agent reproduction
  *Yellow	-hints
  *Cyan		-
simulation notification

  *Purple	-selected agent mutation
  *Brown	-selected agent removal
  *Neon 	-
selected agent reproduction
  *Mint		-simulation start/restart
+ At furthest zoom, all agents are forced to display, and their radii are normalized to more easily see global populations
  especially useful if the populations happen to be tiny creatures
+ New program icon! (I may be way more pleased about this than I should be...)
+ Added/changed Selected Agent HUD, huge refactoring to allow instant reorganization and addition
  ~ Now more organized (slightly) and understandable
  + Volume value (loud/quiet)
  + Waste deposition rate (incontinent/prudent)
  + Exhaustion bar graph
  ~ Grab strength value if grabbing
  ~ Stomach graph again has text of agent classification over it
~ All agent selection keyboard shortcuts have changed: are now the number keys, eg [1]= oldest, [2]= Best Gen, etc, [0] for random
~ Health agent color scheme now displays dead agents as red (instead of black), sharp outline
~ Doubled size of eyesight profile display
~ Changed Tone output from colored box to colored "T" based on the same tone scheme
~ Changed Temp Sensor input from colored box to colored "T" based on the Temp Discomfort
~ Changed collision indicator so it doesn't spawn itself if another indicator (like reproduction or stabbed) is being dislayed

Reporting and Saving:
+ Number of, and best generation of Amphibians is now reported 
+ Current day is reported to assist with the larger Epoch datasets
+ Autosaves now run on days (every 5) instead of Epochs, which are now too long (see above, World & Simulation section)
* OLD SAVES: Rated as "Compatible, but with severe changes in behavior"





January 2017
Evagents v0.01:
Agents:
+ Agents are now more persistent after death
  *Agents are deleted ~1500 frames after their death. In the meantime, their brains and outputs are frozen, their wheels slowly come to a 
   halt, and they loose collision, spiking, etc, and cell interaction ceases. They stop vocalizing, sexual projecting, and auto-selection
  *These agents can still be seen, smelled, blood-sensed (max value!), heard (for a short time), selected, and healed back to life
  *Provide a "homing beacon" of sorts to carnivores. After being killed, agent carcases should alert other agents to the location of meat
+ Generosity changed; now allows for parasites to develop:
  *Nearly every agent will share health (dissables at only exactly 0 output ["Selfish"]).
  *Between 0 and 0.5, health is shared at a rate of FOODTRANSFER*2*(output): nothing near 0, 50% at 0.25, and 100% at 0.5,
   but the agents must be touching ["Autocentric"].
  *Beyond 0.5 and to 1, FOOD_SHARING_RANGE is used instead, and health is again shared at a rate ranging from 50% to 100% between 0.5 and 1
   ["Generous"]. If the bots happen to be touching while give is >0.5, 100% of FOODTRANSFER is given instead (as if maxxed autocentric)
  *Why? This will allow parasitism, as a species with 0 give and that can latch onto another, non-zero give species, will find life easier.
   When other bots touch, they will be more cooperative, possibly leading to more impressive colonies.
   Non-trading species are still possible, but this unlocks new possibilies
+ Eye and Ear copy mutations possible, very low chance, even lower chance that all traits are coppied. Ear direction copy not allowed
+ Young agents take minimum of half-damage from hazard until TENDERAGE is reached, to improve chances of mutations in established species
  *TENDERAGE now controls two features: babies give reduced meat deposition on death and reduced hazard deposition while alive.
+ Hazard/waste drop rate of agents now multiplied by health: Healthy bots leave lots of waste b/c they've eaten, unhealthy ones haven't
+ New agent trait: strength. Wheels now don't get immediately set to their output value, but rather pass through the strength "delay", 
  similar to brain's kp

- Removed MAXMETABOLISM because now metabolism is in range [0,1] and works differently (see below in the changes, "=", section).
- Metabolism no longer effects bot movement speed
- AGING healthloss set to zero. Feature of MAXAGE has not removed, can be re-enabled in settings.cfg. Live mutations more dangerous
- Agent Smell no longer takes distance into account. Simply counts the number of agents within DIST
- Removed references to old brains. We are running DRAWSBrain (renamed MLPBrain) exclusively, and we'll make changes to that as needed

~ Grabbing force effect refactored: reduced jitter when struggling, now has angle limitation to init grab (90 degrees in front)
~ Bite now has an output minimum threshold (the addition of CONN throw made it too easy to trigger)
~ Max value of numbabies used for random agents moved from 4 to 6
~ Increased mutation rates, decreased change in mutation sizes. Live mutations reworked, emit purple event, now main cause of aging issues
~ Increased parent health penalty for large radius assexual reproduction
~ Metabolism changed: now effects ratio of intake put to health vs repcounter. 0.5 is even split, but now agents can prioritize
  *This effect won't matter if health is less than MINMOMHEALTH (priority health)
~ Agent speed reliance on radius refactored to take into account larger MEANRADIUS's, also make bigger bots slower and smaller bots faster 
  than how they were before (small bots were terribly slow before adjustment)
~ Clock 3 minimum frequency changed to 5

Sim:
+ New configurable Settings:
  *BRAINSIZE now available!!! PLEASE NOTE you cannot use old saves with this version IF you change the config value to something smaller.
   Going forward this will not be an issue because this constant is now saved with worldsaves.
  *MEANRADIUS, where random agents are spawned with a radius between 0.2*this and 2.2*this, currently = 10.0
  *REPRATE, the count of food intake it takes to allow reproduction, = 20.0
  *OVERHEAL_REPFILL, true/false flag for health overflow to be redirected to repcounter. True conserves matter, false balances efficient 
   metabolism so as to not favor very low values (if overflow->repcounter enabled, metabolism that prefers health filling has large reward)
  *MOONLIT, t/f flag for whether or not agents can see other agents at night, instead of total blindness. Slower processing if turned on
  *MUTCHANCE, is exactly the value agents use for MUTRATE1, the chance of mutations. Init bots have +/- METAMUTRATE1*3 (+/- 0.003)
  *MUTSIZE, is exactly the value agents use for MUTRATE2, the size of mutations. Init bots have +/- METAMUTRATE2*15 (+/- 0.0003)
  *Made settings.cfg more truthful in general and perfomed some style and organization updates. Old configs are compatable, but if a version
   mismatch is detected, it will warn the user and if allowed to continue, overwrite the old .cfg. Additionally, the right-click context menu
   has "Rewrite Config" and "Reload Config" options.
+ Refactored Instant Hazards: no longer forget the old (approximate) value of waste present before they occured, and replace that value
  after the event expires.
+ Added Relative selection type: when another agent is selected, switching to this mode will automatically select other agents with similar
  species ID, ages, and/or gencounts when the selected agent dies. Selecting other agents does not disable this mode
+ Added manual liveMutate key for selected agent: '~' will initiate a mutation event on selected agent

- FRUITREQUIRE disassociated from fruit spawning check. Any non-zero plant cell can spawn fruit, but it will decay unless FRUITREQUIRE is met

= Sexual Projection now required on the mother to be true in order to initiate sexual reproduction. Replaces random chance and removes rape
  (well, unwanted pregnancies, anyway. Gee, I think I may be designing a better world than God...)
= Sunlight now only gives 0.25 base value to eyesight in daytime instead of 0.5. New MOONLIT flag doesn't disable light collection at night
= Almost all food settings adjusted to accomodate fruit, plant, and metabolism changes
= Refactored and globalized stats; now the world actively keeps track of population counts and best gens instead of on-demand, which happens
  more often. Should speed up program

Graphics and Reporting:
+ New Event system!
  *World and Sim events are recorded, and displayed as text for a short time, with fancy fade in/fade out action!
  *The length of time they are displayed is real time, not sim time (skipdraw and fast mode do not count against the expiration counter)
  *Events include: Selected agent dieing, stabbing, mutating, and other indicator-activating events, Autosave events, World resets, and more
  *Only max of 10 are displayed at a time, but any overflow will not be skipped. Rather, if lots of event messages, they will slowly cycle
  *Added Tips: short messages telling the user info about how to use and read the sim, some display frequently at simulation start.
+ New selected agent Profiles:
  *The old brain display and inputs & outputs display made into "profiles". Now brain visual can be toggled on, only I/O, or off
  *Eyesight profile: Shows colored disks of what the eyes of the agent sees, where horizontal position represents angle, size represents fov.
  The visual representation of the eyes themselves also change color to that which it sees in this mode
  *Sound profile: Ears get different colors, and a graph showing hearing ranges (both broad and best) of each ear, the output of the agent
  (double-thick line colored according to tone), and ALL nearby audio sources, not just the ones the agent can actually hear. Vertical height
  represents volume adjusted for distance and selected's hearing mod, green lines represent wheel-sounds (all lie on 0.25 tone)
+ Repcounter is now graphically visualized next to health in the world
+ New indicator tags:
  *Ears. Shows the volume value the ears of every agent are detecting. Aren't rendered if no sound is heard.
  *Metabolism: yellow if high metabolism, purple if low
+ At close zoom, a grid appears to help orient the user, especially if following an agent. Added GUI option to always show grid
+ Temp layer is back! But for now is only a visual thing (should probably try to not force the program to generate a new 2d array of zeros..)
+ Pressing 'r' while on the main window will select a random alive agent. 'R' (Shift+'r') will select a random agent regardless of state
+ Report.txt additions: random agent's metabolism, random agent's red color, another random agent's green, and another's blue
+ More verbose debug code; beware of the output window!

= removed stimulant report on selected agent display, changed to strength: 0-0.3 is "Weak!", 0.3-0.7 is "Not Weak", 0.7+ is "Strong!"
= Visual for light changed to indicate when MOONLIT is on, has a grey background instead of navy blue
= Selected agent visualization changes:
  +New health, repcounter, and stomach efficiency graphs on selected agent display
  -Removed old text stomach report, colored bars now indicate the stomach efficiencies
  -Removed repcounter text report next to all agents
  =Replaced health text report with colored species id (same as the visualization mode)
   Also changed the scale of the color for the metabolism on the repcounter text to fit new range
  =Spikes, wheels are always rendered on the selected agent display
  =FIXED spike reporting damage value when agent is driving wrong way, thus incapable of spiking. Still reported as spiked
  *Brought back selected agent being outlined in a double-wide drawn circle, originally seen in Social Bots, a legacy program
= Amphibious agents are now distinguished by pink-ish hue on indicator
= Land/water and metabolism agent colorization schemes available for selection
= Report now formatted to better work with Excel right away rather than require data processing

Fixes:
= Internal: some heavy optimization passes, especially in drawing code
= Internal: Introduced a form of tree processing to agent-agent interaction code. Now each agent checks to see if it's "near" another,
  and only if so is it processed. Conditions for being "near" depend on ranges of Give, Grab, Spike, and Bite, all which are processed mod%2
  Huge improvements to large-population processing
= Internal: made tag rendering code addition-friendly, allowing new indicator tags to be created easily
= FIXED: brain boxes global weight mutations still had a >0 limit set, but a range including negatives, forcing mutated boxes to output 0.5
  this bug caused: *RGB colors similar for sepparate species, *brains seem to decay over time, and other unnoticed output issues
= FIXED: Having a NUMEYES different than 4 would not actually input the extra (or fewer) eyes into the brain. It is officially difficult to 
  add custom per-bot numeyes, so every bot must have the same number of eyes now.
= FIXED: jaws would not cause damage to agents when visually they should have been due to proximity and alignment
= FIXED: bug where changing FRAMES_PER_EPOCH and REPORTS_PER_EPOCH would have unexpected results (Reports per Epoch messed up)
