settings.cfg
This file will be regenerated with default values if missing (regeneration is not necessary for the program to work)
Modify any value in this file to change constants in Evagents.
All changes will require a reset or relaunch to take effect

Any lines that the program can't recognize are silently ignored, and anything that is changed is reported by the program.
Please note the sim only takes the last entry of a flag's value if there are duplicates. Also, can you find the hidden config flags?...

Remember to RIGHT-CLICK and select LOAD CONFIG, or relaunch the program after modification!!!
